                While riding I have ridden in horse shows and ridden western as well as english and bareback. 
               From horse shows I have won rosettes and my most recent show rossetts.

               I have also been taught to ride Hunter Jumper and competed in Hunter shows as well as western showmanship.
              On top of showing I have taken many clinics with Grand Prix Jumper Reagan Roberts.

               As well as taking lots of clinics I have also recently been training as well as helping to recover and strenghen a mare named Mille. </div>
              I have been training her in hopes that she could be used as a lesson horse for new riders.
